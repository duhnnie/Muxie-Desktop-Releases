## Expanding Device Support

Currently, our app supports the **iPod Classic** and **iPod Video** running the original Apple's software and **any device capable of generating a .scrobbler.log file** like Rockbox-powered devices and some Sony Walkman devices with installed addons/custom firmares (this case last not tested by Muxie developer).

We are exploring the possibility of supporting additional iPod models (and other portable devices) in future updates.

If you would like to help, we may need you to provide some information and a few files from your device.

For that read our guide about [Expanding Device Support](DEVICE_SUPPORT.md).
